        <li>Settings Dialog</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 5.1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript engine is updated up to version v3.0.0. Now await and async instructions are available in JS.</li>
        <li>Logger starts a new file when the file size (or the nubmer of lines) is more than a user defined value.</li>
        <li>The status bar (with log messages) keeps a limited user defined number of messages.</li>

    <h2>Version 4.2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Event hadlers MeasurementStarted, MeasurementEnded are assigned when palmsense.PSCommSimpleWPF is set.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 4.1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            MethodScript functionality was added for EmStat Pico. Use palmsense.RunMethodScript(string path, string csv="") to execute MethodScript and save it to a csv file.
        </li>
        <li>
            PalmSens SDK for WPF version updated from 5.7 to 5.9.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Version 4.0</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The new chamber supports BME680 temperature/humidity sensor.
            Check help page to know how to switch between different modes of operation.
        </li>
        <li>Number of points on the temperature chart is increased up to 100.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 3.2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Command palmsense.SaveMeasurements is now a sync method. That means that JS execution will be halted untill CSV file is saved. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 3.1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Jint interpreter updated to v3.0.0-beta-2036</li>
        <li>
            JavaScript execution can be <u>stopped when the current statement is complete</u> with Stop button.
            JavaScript execution can be <u>immediately terminated</u> with Kill button.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript can be saved to hard disk. Button "Save" added to Main menu.</li>
        <li>
            Added support for multichannel Palmsense measurements. Execute palmsense.Measure(channel) to measure a single channel. Ommit argument <i>channel</i> for measurements without MUX.
        </li>
        <div>
            Alternatively: If <i>palmsense.Measure(ch)</i> doesn't work or sequentiall measurements needed, try <i>palmsense.SetupMUX(bool[] array)</i>,
            where array is an array of booleans representing the channel states, for example {true, true, false, false, false, false, false} to measure first two channels.
        </div>
        <li>Temperature regulator set value should be given in 0.1 Celcius deg. <b>Important! setTemp(37) will try to run PID at 3.7C which is almost unreachable for a small Peltier and completely impossible in a setup with only heating element. </b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 3.0</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The new chamber supports heating element (not Peltier). Temperature can be set using menu button 'Set temp' or in Java Script using arduino.setTemp(int t).</li>
        <li>Blinking indicator showing communication to Arduino.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 2.4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Support of AHT10 temperature/humidity sensor board. Use AHT10 compiler tag to build an application with AHT10 support.
            Humidity can be read from JS using arduino.Humidity.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 2.3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Max flow rate acceptable by arduino.setFlow is back to 200 ccm/min. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version 2.2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug with arduino.setFlow fixed. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 2.1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Read arduino.Temperature to get current temperature.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 2.0</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug with restore of the width of JavaScript list has been fixed.</li>
        <li>
            This version is designed for the new arduino shield. The new shield has external DAC and ADC modules.
            If you need to work with the old shield, remove compilation symbol I2C from project build settings. External DAC can output
            voltage from 0 to 5V with 12 bit resolution. External ADC can measure +/- 6.144V with 16 bit resolution, thus 1 bit = 0.1875mV.
            <i>The new shield works only with the new firmware of arduino. </i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Event handler <i>SimpleCurveStartReceivingData</i> removed after Palmsense measurement completion.
            It can solve the bug with doubling of data in CSV file.
        </li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Version 1.4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            JSListWidth, last selected COM port are now preserved between sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bug with NullReferenceException during execution of Measure method has been fixed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version 1.3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            More space for temperature chart added.
        </li>
        <li>
            If <i>Don't show next time</i> checkbox is set, <i>What's New</i> dialog won't be displayed next time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version 1.2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Function SaveMeasurements of IPalmsense interface now has the 2nd optional parameter <i>csv</i> which is defualt to False.
            If <i>csv</i> is True Palmsense measurements are saved in CSV table rather than pssession file.
            <br />
            Example:<br />
            <i>palmsense.SaveMeasurements("test.csv", true);</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Help</i> page added.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>What's new</i> page added.
        </li>
        <li>
            Java Script editor, <i>Execute script</i> menu button are disabled during script execution. Script editor changes background color to grey while script execution.
        </li>
